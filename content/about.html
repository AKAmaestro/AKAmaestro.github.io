                            <p class="bio-text">Growing up across India in a military family taught me to read new
                                environments quickly and stay curious about every culture I encountered. That curiosity
                                fuels how I explore - whether it's hiking new landscapes, capturing moments on my phone,
                                or chasing local food.</p>
                            <p class="bio-text">I'm a multi-faceted engineer and artist with a practical,
                                resourceful approach to problem-solving. I love building systems, prototyping ideas, and
                                stitching together robotics, AI, and game design to create expressive experiences.</p>
                            <p class="bio-text">Collaboration is my default mode. I believe in intentional choices that
                                shape our trajectory, and I bring a versatile toolkit to every brief. I'm currently
                                leading Amnesea Studios and always ready for the next challenge.</p>
